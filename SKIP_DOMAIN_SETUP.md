# How to Skip Domain Registration on Cloudflare

## ✅ You DON'T Need a Domain!

Cloudflare Pages gives you a **FREE subdomain** automatically. Here's how to skip the domain step:

### Option 1: Look for "Skip" Button
- On the domain setup page, look for:
  - **"Skip"** button (usually at bottom)
  - **"Continue without domain"**
  - **"Use Cloudflare subdomain"**
  - **"Set up later"**

### Option 2: Leave Domain Field Empty
- If there's a text field for domain:
  - **Leave it completely empty**
  - Click **"Continue"** or **"Next"**

### Option 3: Use the Free Subdomain Option
- Look for:
  - **"Use Cloudflare Pages subdomain"**
  - **"Get a free .pages.dev domain"**
  - **"I'll set up a domain later"**

### What Happens Next:
After skipping, Cloudflare will:
1. Create your site automatically
2. Give you a free URL like: `https://my-music-website.pages.dev`
3. You can add a custom domain later (optional)

## 🎯 Quick Answer:

**Just click "Skip" or leave the domain field empty and continue!**

You'll get a free `.pages.dev` URL that works perfectly.

## 📝 If You Can't Find Skip:

1. Look at the **bottom** of the page for small text like "Skip" or "Continue without domain"
2. Try clicking **"Continue"** or **"Next"** even with empty domain field
3. If stuck, try going back and looking for "Deploy without domain" option

---

**Your site will work perfectly with the free subdomain!** You can always add a custom domain later if you want.
