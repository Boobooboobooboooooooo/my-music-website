# Push to GitHub - Quick Steps

## ✅ Your code is ready! Now create a GitHub repo:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `my-music-website`
3. Description (optional): "My Music Website"
4. **Don't** check "Initialize with README"
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-music-website.git
```

### Step 3: Tell Me Your GitHub Username

Once you create the repo, tell me your:
- **GitHub username**
- **Repository name** (probably `my-music-website`)

Then I'll push the code for you!

## OR: Push It Yourself

If you want to do it yourself, after creating the repo, run:

```bash
cd "/Users/peewee/Desktop/My Music Website"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-music-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Your code is already committed and ready to push!** 🚀
