# Create GitHub Repository First

## The repository doesn't exist yet. Here's how to create it:

### Step 1: Create the Repository

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `my-music-website`
3. **Description (optional):** "My Music Website"
4. **Visibility:** Public (or Private - your choice)
5. **IMPORTANT:** Don't check "Initialize with README"
6. **Click:** "Create repository"

### Step 2: After Creating, Tell Me

Once you've created the repository, let me know and I'll push the code!

---

## OR: Push It Yourself (After Creating Repo)

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/peewee/Desktop/My Music Website"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Boobooboobooboooooooo/my-music-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** You might be asked for your GitHub username and password (or personal access token).

---

## Alternative: Use SSH (If You Have It Set Up)

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Boobooboobooboooooooo/my-music-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Your code is ready - just need the repository to exist first!** 🚀
